The notebook takes a user specified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and pour points based on any Locations of Interest (LOI) to generate respective drainage catchment polygons. The notebook also takes the user specified Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model grid shapefile, HRU streamflow out csv, and the generated catchment areas of the specified pour points to output PRMS unimpaired flow estimates by each LOI. In this example, the LOIs are called "Points_merge_m_ExportFeature," and represent biological assessment sites received from the contractors. The pour point shapefile also needs the default "OBJECTID" field for this script to work properly. If an "OBJECTID" field does not exist, the user can (A) create an "OBJECTID" attribute for the pour points shapefile specified and populate each row with arbitrary sequential numbers prior to running this notebook OR (B)  modify this code to read another integer attribute in liue of the OBJECTID (i.e., "FID").  All inputs need to be in a geodatabase. See the Inputs section of this notebook for more details. Please note that ArcPy is required for this notebook to completely work. ArcPy is a licensed ESRI product and can be accessed through the python intepreter provided by the ArcPro installation.
